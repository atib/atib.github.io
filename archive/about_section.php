              <p class="body">Unravelling the world of user experience and interface design has been one of the most pleasing journeys thus far, enabling me to create aesthetically pleasing applications whilst keeping functionality in mind. </p>

              <p class="body">My path into UX design and UI development may have been non-traditional but this has given me a valuable insight into developing applications that would hopefully produce a greater impact to society. </p>

              <p class="body">I design & develop using a range of awesome technologies such as: HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS. I use Illustrator, Axure or Balsamiq when I'm doing wireframes for UX & UI designs (not forgetting good ol' pen and paper).</p>
